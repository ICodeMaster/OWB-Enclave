Enclave reborn adds an entirely new nation to Old World Blues. This Enclave faction is the last rally of the remnant forces, determined to avenge Navarro and reclaim the unites states. 

Two factions have grown within their leadership, the Purists and the Reformers.
The Purists, driven by revanchism against the NCR and the brotherhood, seek to continue the original vision of the Enclave. To reclaim the United States and purify it from the mutants. They are led by Franklin Anderson, who has whipped up his supporters with fanaticism far beyond the original Enclave.

The Reformers wish to see the United States restored to its former glory, even if it means compromising with or even incorporating the wastelanders. They are led by Douglas Granite, a son of a Poseidon veteran and leader of a mercenary company.

Currently only the Purists are implemented!
