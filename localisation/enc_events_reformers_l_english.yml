enc_reformers.13.d: "Tensions have been high since the elections. It appears support for the Purists has only intensified as a result, especially in the upper echelons of our government.

enc_reformers.16.t: "Assassination attempt!"
enc_reformers.16.d: "'Death to traitors!' An officer screams as he pulls out a Plasma pistol and opens fire. The first bolt misses completely and the second grazes your side. There is no third as the would be assassin is put down by security. You are alive, but even a graze from a Plasma bolt is a wound one carries to the grave. \n\n The attempt on your life has left you scarred, a burning reminder of how close the Enclave is to complete collapse."
enc_reformers.16.a: "The time for patience is over."
enc_reformers.16.b: "Keep this quiet."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.17.t: "Unfortunate news!"
enc_reformers.17.d: "Unfortunately, it appears some of our soldiers have taken up the practice of blasting a pre-war song on from their vertibirds during routine patrols.

The propagandic value of such a collection should not be underestimated as very little music is available to those within the Enclave. "

enc_reformers.18.b: "Promote Old World nostalgia."
enc_reformers.18.c: "Release the tapes freely."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.19.t: "Fist fight breaks out!"
enc_reformers.19.d: "A heated argument turned violent in the general staff cafetaria today. Unsuprisingly, the topic of the argument was the recent elections. Though many claim that he was prevoked, none deny that the person defending the Reformer cause threw the first punch. This normally insignficant issue is gathering a lot of attention and we have been asked to intervene. An ungrateful position to be in, since defending the aggressor would reflect badly on us, but condemning him would come across as a stab in the back to the most zealous reformers."
enc_reformers.19.a: "Blame aggressor."
enc_reformers.19.b: "Defend aggressor."
enc_reformers.19.c: "Condemn both."
