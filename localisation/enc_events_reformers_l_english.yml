enc_reformers.1.t:0 "Douglas' Youth"
enc_reformers.1.d:0 "There is controversy regarding Granite’s Father and his relation to the Chosen One. The Purists accuse Granite’s Father of treason for aiding the Chosen One and destroying the Oil Rig, however there is no evidence proving these claims. Granite however is curious about these allegations, thus Granite takes it upon himself to ask his retired father about whether these claims are true or not. Regardless whether it is true or not, Granite will say that those claims are nothing but slander from rivals. ."
enc_reformers.1.a:0 "He aided the Chosen One and then went their seperate ways."
enc_reformers.1.b:0 "He aided the Chosen One and settled in Arroyo where he met and married a local woman ."
enc_reformers.1.c:0 "He didn't aid the Chosen One."

enc_reformers.2.c:0 "Caesar's scouts seeking new lands"

enc_reformers.3.t:0 "Douglas' Decision"
enc_reformers.3.d:0 "He decided to..."
enc_reformers.3.a:0 "Aid them in their quest to improve the Wastes"
enc_reformers.3.a.tt: "This will give us a connection with this faction."
enc_reformers.3.b:0 "Wipe them out lest they reveal the Enclave's survival."
enc_reformers.3.tt:0 "Douglas Granite is a practical man. ."
#########################################################################################
enc_reformers.4.t:0 "Dealing with Wrights"
enc_reformers.4.d:0 "Some say that the Wright family has spent the last few decades building with one hand and destroying with the other, but compared to the other families this makes them almost redeemable. Mr.. Wright's vision of a more peaceful and stable New Reno is not entirely incompatible with out own..."
enc_reformers.4.a:0 "Allow him go legit."
enc_reformers.4.b:0 "There is no place for his kind here."
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.5.t:0 "Dealing with Bishops"
enc_reformers.5.d:0 "The Bishops may have been the most powerful family in New Reno, a dangerous man for many reasons, one of which are his numerous political connections in the NCR. Mr. Bishop's gangsters were loyal enough to face down the other families, but the sight of X-01 power armor sent them scattered. He has retreated to his mansion, accompanied by only his closest and most loyal, surrounded by our forces and trapped."
enc_reformers.5.a:0 "Focus on capturing their assets."
enc_reformers.5.b:0 "Focus on apprehending the leader."
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.6.t:0 "Dealing with Salvatores"
enc_reformers.6.d:0 "The Salvatores have been useful to the Enclave in the past, willing to deal with us in order to expand their own influence in New Reno. Perhaps they can be useful once again. A puppet ruling New Reno in our name could help make the situation in the city less suspicious to any outside observers.\n\nMr. Salvatores old smuggling connections may also prove a valuable resource to us, should we decide to keep him alive."
enc_reformers.6.a:0 "He can rule as a puppet."
enc_reformers.6.b:0 "He can live under house arrest."
enc_reformers.6.c:0 "We rule in New Reno now."
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.7.t:0 "Dealing with Mordinos"
enc_reformers.7.d:0 "The Mordinos long represented the status quo of New Reno. That is to say, criminality, exploitation, drugs and misery. They had many allies but no friends and few are now willing to lay their lives down in defence of the drug lords. We may strike quickly and expect only limited resistance, but some have suggested that we should use the Mordinos to demonstrate we are serious about our Old World values."
enc_reformers.7.a:0 "They will be tried in a court of law."
enc_reformers.7.b:0 "Justice is long overdue."
########################################################################################
enc_reformers.8.t:0 "Secrets Stolen"
enc_reformers.8.d:0 "Last night, a small group of traitors made off with a vertibird and almost all of our old military codes. Their communications suggest that they were opportunists who saw a better future in selling the codes than wherever the Enclave is headed. \n\nRegardless of their intentions, this betrayal is a severe blow. Many old military bases, including the heavily fortified lower levels of the Sierra Army Depot are now forever lost to us."
enc_reformers.8.a:0 "Good riddance. We don't need them."
enc_reformers.8.b:0 "Blame the Purists."
#########################################################################################
enc_reformers.9.t: "Promotion"
enc_reformers.9.d: "One of our older military theorists has just retired. There are two available candidates eligable for promotion. An older, experienced Navarro veteran and a younger, outspoken reformer."
enc_reformers.9.a: "Promote the experienced man"
enc_reformers.9.b: "Promote the loyal man"
#########################################################################################
enc_reformers.10.t: "The Assassination of Mr. Bishop"
enc_reformers.10.d: "Mr. Bishop, once the top dog in New Reno, died today after he was attacked in his safehouse by a team of Enclave spies posing as henchmen that fled New Reno.\n\nAfter the Enclave took over his city, Mr. Bishop spent his days attempting to bring our return to light, but treaded carefuly to avoid his own identity and location from becoming public knowledge.\n\nThis did little to protect him and only delayed his efforts in the end."
enc_reformers.10.a: "Excellent news"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.11.t: "Traitors in the Officers Corps!"
enc_reformers.11.d: "The recent elections have stirred up latent tensions in our officer corps. Many of our most experienced and respected military leadership are Navarro veterans and there is not a man among them who has not lost a comrade there. It is unsurprising many of them have been taken in by Anderson's message of revenge against the NCR and mutants alike. With our government moving in another direction, tensions are high and there are whispers of traitors."
enc_reformers.11.a: "We will have to deal with them later"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.12.t: "Traitors among our scientists!"
enc_reformers.12.d: "Many of our best and brightest were once part of the secret projects performed at Navarro and the rig. For this, they were persecuted relentlessly after the fall of Navarro. None of them have forgotten this, few have forgiven it. Since the recent elections, progress on some projects has slowed down, laboratory equipment has gone missing and reports of unpatriotic behaviour have become common."
enc_reformers.12.a: "We will have to deal with them later"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.13.t: "Preparing our speech"
enc_reformers.13.d: "Tensions have been high since the elections. It appears support for the Purists has only intensified as a result, especially in the upper echelons of our government. To address this situation, we have collected all those with grievances towards the new US government into one room. They are awaiting answers from their new president, so you prepare..."
enc_reformers.13.a: "your speech."
enc_reformers.13.b: "shaped explosives."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.14.t: "Anderson Holds a Speech"
enc_reformers.14.dd: "Despite his near defeat in the recent elections, Franklin Anderson has been working tirelessly to rouse his supporters against the new administration. Though he carefully chooses his words to avoid anything openly treasonous, most believe the only real reason he is alive and allowed to speak is that his numerous supporters may be driven to open revolt otherwise."
enc_reformers.14.a: "A man must know when he is beaten."
enc_reformers.14.b: "Make sure it's not broadcast at least."
enc_reformers.14.c: "You are running of of friends quickly, Anderson."
enc_reformers.14.c.tt: "Available because you have completed §YPurge The Officers§!."
enc_reformers.14.d: "You are running of of friends quickly, Anderson."
enc_reformers.14.d.tt: "Available because you have completed §YPurge The Scientists§!."
enc_reformers.14.e: "You are out of friends, Anderson."
enc_reformers.14.e.tt: "Available because you have completed both §YPurge The Officers§! and §YPurge The Scientists§!."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.15.t: "Promotion for Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force"
enc_reformers.15.d: "While the role is smaller than its historic predecessor, air power is still vital to the Enclave's armed forces. "
enc_reformers.15.a: "The best man should get the job."
enc_reformers.15.b: "We need a man we can trust."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.16.t: "Assassination attempt!"
enc_reformers.16.d: "'Death to traitors!' An officer screams as he pulls out a Plasma pistol and opens fire. The first bolt misses completely and the second grazes your side. There is no third as the would be assassin is put down by security. You are alive, but even a graze from a Plasma bolt is a wound one carries to the grave. \n\n The attempt on your life has left you scarred, a burning reminder of how close the Enclave is to complete collapse."
enc_reformers.16.a: "The time for patience is over."
enc_reformers.16.b: "Keep this quiet."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.17.t: "Unfortunate news!"
enc_reformers.17.d: "Unfortunately, it appears some of our soldiers have taken up the practice of blasting a pre-war song on from their vertibirds during routine patrols. It does not need explaining how this behaviour is reckless and needlessly conspicuous. None the less, our popularity must be considered in these uncertain times."
enc_reformers.17.a: "Crack down on this behaviour"
enc_reformers.17.b: "Just ask them to turn it down"
enc_reformers.17.c: "Just ask them to turn it UP"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.18.t: "Music vault found!"
enc_reformers.18.d: "During their efforts to clean up some of the smaller criminal organizations, Enclave soldiers have stumbled on a treasure trove of pre-war audiotapes. The vast majority of the tapes have survives and hold long lost tunes of the Old World, collected by a wealthy crime lord over the course of decades. The propagandistic value of such a collection should not be underestimated as very little music is available to those within the Enclave. "
enc_reformers.18.a: "Promote patriotic songs."
enc_reformers.18.b: "Promote Old World nostalgia."
enc_reformers.18.c: "Release the tapes freely."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.19.t: "Fist fight breaks out!"
enc_reformers.19.d: "A heated argument turned violent in the general staff cafeteria today. Unsurprisingly, the topic of the argument was the recent elections. Though many claim that he was provoked, none deny that the person defending the Reformer cause threw the first punch. This normally insignificant issue is gathering a lot of attention and we have been asked to intervene. An ungrateful position to be in, since defending the aggressor would reflect badly on us, but condemning him would come across as a stab in the back to the most zealous reformers."
enc_reformers.19.a: "Blame aggressor."
enc_reformers.19.b: "Defend aggressor."
enc_reformers.19.c: "Condemn both."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.20.t: "Bishop escapes to the NCR!"
enc_reformers.20.d: "It appears that Mr. Bishop has slipt through our fingers, boarding a secret vertibird for the NCR. His location is currently unclear. We must consider the possibility that he may attempt to pull strings in the New California Republic to turn the bear's attention to us as a means of getting revenge."
enc_reformers.20.a: "They won't believe him."
enc_reformers.20.b: "Let's not leave that loose end untied."
enc_reformers.20.b.tt: "You will have §Y200 days§! to assassinate §YMr. Bishop§!!"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.21.t: "Spies compromised!"
enc_reformers.21.d: "We have received an emergency transmission from our espionage in the New California Republic. They claim to have been compromised and have abandoned their base of operations as a result. Days away from the border and on foot, they are asking for emergency evacuation.\n\nHeroic extractions and 'no man left behind' looks good in after action reports, but we need to consider our operational security as a whole when considering our response. "
enc_reformers.21.a: "Send an extraction team by vertibird."
enc_reformers.21.a.d: "---\nA vertibird could bring our infiltrators back home in no time and reflect well on us internally, but an emergency flight is sure to arouse some suspicion."
enc_reformers.21.b: "Authorize an unsupported retreat."
enc_reformers.21.b.tt: "the spies sneaking out successfully."
enc_reformers.21.b.d: "---\nOur spies are resourceful, they can make it back on their own. Too much support from our side would only increase the risks."
enc_reformers.21.c: "Order them to relocate within the New California Republic."
enc_reformers.21.c.tt: "the spies relocating successfully."
enc_reformers.21.c.d: "---\nNo need to call our operations off over someone getting cold feet, a relocation is enough."
enc_reformers.21.c.rs: "The spies will go radio silent for §Y7 days§!, afterwards: "
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.22.t: "Contact with spies lost!"
enc_reformers.22.d: "Contact has been lost with our spy team in the New California Republic.\nThere is currently no telling weither they were KIA, captured or even gone rogue. Some are still holding out hope that our espionage team went silent to cover their tracks but we should expect the worst and plan accordingly. "
enc_reformers.22.a: "They knew the risks."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.24.t: "Explosion in the meeting room!"
enc_reformers.24.d: "Tragedy struck today as a gas leak caused a lethal explosion in the conference room where many of our administrators had gathered to discuss recent policy changes with the President. Due to the limited size of the conference room, the devastation was absolute and there were no survivors.\n\nOnly by God's grace did Douglas survive as he was running late due to an emergency meeting with the demolitions department."
enc_reformers.24.a: "There but for the grace of God, go I."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.25.t: "Anderson goes into hiding!"
enc_reformers.25.d: "Despite assurances that the recent disaster was accidental in nature, Franklin Anderson, leader of the Purist faction within the Enclave, has seen fit to board a vertibird with a few of his closest followers and departed for an unknown location.\n\nDespite this, we have reasons to believe he is still communicating with his followers in the Enclave, who have become much more private with their political convinctions recently."
enc_reformers.25.a: "Going AWOL is nothing short of treason."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.26.t: "Questions about the NCR"
enc_reformers.26.d: "It appears the Purists have been spreading the rumor that we are looking to compromise with the New California Republic. Some have even dared suggest we would surrender to our old and hated nemesis.\n\nPurists, moderates and even many Reformers have absolutely no intention of letting bygones be bygones. Thus, the question is posed during our conference. What to do with the NCR?"
enc_reformers.26.a: "We have no intention of compromising with the NCR."
enc_reformers.26.a.tt: "§M\nYou promised not to make peace with the NCR!§!"

enc_reformers.26.b: "Dodge the question."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.27.t: "Questions about the mutants"
enc_reformers.27.d: "While we have made much progress in introducing the idea of outsiders as something else than target practice, many are still unsure about our intentions towards the mutants.\n\nRumors have ranged from possible integration of wastelanders into our ranks to ridiculous suggestions of forced intermarriage between pure and unpure humans.\n\nIt appears that there are many doubting Purists and moderates who would be much more at ease after the promise of a peaceful, but seperated existance, provided the mutants know who is in charge.\n\nAnd so the question was posed: 'what about the mutants?'."
enc_reformers.27.a: "The will be no integration with the mutants."
enc_reformers.27.a.tt: "§M\nYou promised not to integrate the wastelanders!§!"
enc_promised_no_integration_broken: "\n§RPromise broken!§!\n"
enc_promised_no_integration_kept: "\n§GPromise kept!§!\n"
enc_reformers.27.b: "What about them?"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.28.t: "Questions about the ghouls"
enc_reformers.28.d: "Some have raised the question of whether we should integrate ghouls into the Enclave.  On the one hand, many of the ghouls we've come across are feral monsters, but it has been pointed out that some of them knew prewar America, and, perversely, are more American than many Wastelanders.."
enc_reformers.28.a: "The will be no integration with the ghouls."
enc_reformers.28.a.tt: "§M\nYou promised not to integrate the ghouls!§!"
enc_promise_broken: "\n§RPromise broken!§!\n"
enc_promise_kept: "\n§GPromise kept!§!\n"
enc_reformers.28.b: "Let me explain the difference between feral and ..."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.29.t: "East Coast Exiles"
enc_reformers.29.d: "To our astonishment, a group of unrecognized vertibird have approached our location with a recognized US callsign. They are led by a man named Schultz sporting Enclave power armor.\n\nSchultz traveled from the Raven Rock facility in the Capitol Wasteland, lead for a verti-assault team dispatched by Colonel Autumn to salvage assets from the ashes of Navarro and the Rig.\n The mission was suicide errand designed by Autumn to purge opposition from his ranks. Those that survived found us, not ruins. \n\nWhile news of this illegitimate 'President Eden' is troubling, most of the Enclave's vertibirds went East with Autumn's father, and Schultz's tactical experience could be invaluable in integrating airpower with Enclave ground forces."
enc_reformers.29.a: "A surprise, but a welcome one."²²
enc_reformers.29.a.tt: "§YMichael Schultz§! now available as §YChief Of Airforce§!"

enc_reformers.30.t: "Spies in NCR relocated successfully"
enc_reformers.30.d: "After a week of radio silence, our spies have reported back to us on a secure channel.\n Their relocation within the New California Republic was a success and they are ready to resume covert activities as before. "

################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.31.t: "Spies in NCR evacuated successfully"
enc_reformers.31.d: "After a week of radio silence, our spies have reported back to us on a secure channel.\nThey have crossed the borders into Enclave controlled territory and are requesting vertibird evac for the rest of the distance home."
enc_reformers.31.a: "They have earned their rest."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.32.t: "Questions about the Brotherhood of Steel"
enc_reformers.32.d: "While not as hated as the NCR, the Brotherhood of Steel played a major role in the destruction of Navarro and the loss of many of our comrades, brothers and fathers.\nIt was inevitable that a voice in the room would be raised to ask what we mean to do with the Power Armored boyscouts occupying so many of our military bases using stolen govermnent property."
enc_reformers.32.a: "Of course we would never ally with them."
enc_reformers.32.a.tt: "§M\nYou promised not to fight alongside the Brotherhood of Steel!§!"
enc_reformers.32.b: "Dodge the question"
enc_reformers.32.c: "The Brotherhood could be pitted against the NCR"

################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.33.t: "The Barons"
enc_reformers.33.d: "Our success in escaping the notice of the NCR may be in part duo to their low level of control over their own northern regions. Instead, there lands are ruled by the brahmin barons, wealthy merchants with only situational loyalty to the NCR government.\n\nWe believe that, with the right encouragement, the Barons could successfuly petition for independence from Shady Sands and the rest of the NCR."
enc_reformers.33.a: "Let's get to work."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.34.t: "The Barons' Petition"
enc_reformers.34.d: "After careful preperation, the barons have pooled their voices into one document. It declares a vote of no confidence by 12 Barons of the north and their demand to be recognized as an independendant state."
enc_reformers.34.a: "They have no choice but to accept"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.35.t: "Petition Succeeds!"
enc_reformers.35.d: "Their hands tied, the NCR congress has decided to recognize the independence of the Baron's Republic. Handing over all demanded territory to the newly founded state. We should move quickly to establish positive relations with them."

enc_reformers.36.a: "Oh fuck"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.37.t: "The Baron calls for aid!"
enc_reformers.37.d: "The newly founded Baron's Republic has called for our assistance in securing their independence from the New California Republic. Accepting will pull us into a war against our arch-nemesis, but refusing may doom a potential ally."
enc_reformers.37.a: "Of course we will help"

enc_reformers.38.d: "Our spies have uncovered a map leading to an abandoned pre-war military depot. It holds a large amount of older power armor suits in working condition.\n\nHowever, this depot is in NCR territory, meaning our efforts may not go unnoticed by the bear."
enc_reformers.38.a: "Excavate what we can"
enc_reformers.38.b: "Cover our tracks instead"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.60.t: "The Ides of March"
enc_reformers.60.d: "The Legion is a formidable foe, but not all within its ranks tolerate Caesar's rule.  Legate Lanius, the 'Monster of the East', thinks he could turn the Legion into a ruthless military machine. Perhaps he could be a useful ally to our bid to unite America...."
enc_reformers.60.a: "He may be a son of a bitch but he'll be our son of a bitch."
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.61.t: "Vae Victis!"

enc_reformers.63.t: "The Society of the Cincinnati"
enc_reformers.63.d: "Enclave propaganda has permeated through the Legion. Tales of righteous heroes like Cincinnatus, who returned to his farm after war; of Scipio and his defeat of Carthage; and Washington.  They now proclaim themselves defenders of the Republic; but which one?"

enc_reformers.65.t: "The Emancipation Proclamation"
enc_reformers.65.d: "As the cities of the Legion rise in revolt, their eyes turn towards the remnants of America that promised freedom.  The president's words rang out across the radio ' Although you have been deprived of your God-given rights by your so-called masters, you are now as free as I am, and if those that claim to be your superiors do not know that you are free, take the sword and bayonet and teach them that you are; and we are the Enclave, and we will be there to help.'"

enc_reformers.66.d: "Mr. House surveys the Enclave from a monitor.  'What I'm offering you is a ground-floor opportunity in the most important enterprise on Earth. What I'm offering is a future - for you, and for what remains of the human race.'

enc_reformers.66.a: "'This is fine'"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc_reformers.67.t: "Ghoul Marriage"
enc_reformers.67.d: "Since we've decided to recognize ghouls as US citizens, an odd situation has come up.  A wastelander from New Reno has demanded we recognize his marriage to a ghoul.  Although we don't interfere with what consenting adults do in their bedrooms (and really don't want to know what these two do in theirs) they have brought a challenge to the new Supreme Court to hear their constitutional challenge.  Although one justice asked whether this was a priority in this grim postnuclear wasteland, another member of the court has argued that civil rights are always important.  The court has three options before it.  The first is to say that the we find ghoul marriage gross and we can deny rights to Americans based on our dislike so long as we aren't imprisoning or executing people.  The second is to note that the 14th Amendment guarantees all US citizens 'the equal protection of the laws' and rule that banning ghoul marriage violates the equal protection clause.  Or we can issue a rambling decision that doesn't give anyone a clear standard to follow in future cases but let's us say 'love is love' and get quoted at weddings."
enc_reformers.67.a: "Adam and Eve not Atom and Eve!"
enc_reformers.67.b: "Adopt an Equal Protection Argument."

enc_reformers.68.t: "Slavery"
enc_reformers.68.d: "During the liberation of New Reno we've come across a large population of slaves, triggering off a debate as to whether we should allow the practice of slavery in these United States.  Although there are those who say slavery is unamerican, others point out that a captive workforce could be a boon to our economy and has historical precedent.  As an compromise we could adopt Vault City's servitude system, providing food, protection, and medical care in exchange for involuntary servitude.  But others say that seems like slavery with extra steps."
enc_reformers.68.a: "Slavery, a boon to our economy."
enc_reformers.68.b: "Vault City's servitude is reasonable."

enc_reformers.70.t: "The Fate of Our Democracy"
enc_reformers.70.d: "New Reno prospers under our rule, but we must decide how to govern the United States.  Douglas's rule has been successful and he's brought us back from the brink.  The nation has been under martial law since the War, and he could cement his power and (frankly better than we could hope) rule. Or he could aim to restore the United States, risking losing control of the Enclave in 'elections' and giving power to the natives."
enc_reformers.70.a: "Extend Presidential powers."

'Our nation, conceived in liberty, has staggered under a great many blows, and we are bloody and bruised.  But we are unbowed, unbent, and unbroken.  Let us hereby resolve that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from this Earth.'"

enc_reformers.72.t: "The Iron President"
enc_reformers.72.d: "Douglas did his best.  But this wasn't the fat and happy world of prewar America.  He had to guide his nation through a nuclear wasteland.  He had no time to listen to whining barons from California, councillors from Vault City, or ministers from New Canaan.  Only blood and iron would save America.  But without liberty, Douglas was sifting through the dust, the ruins.... the shell of America, dead forever."
enc_reformers.72.a: "God Bless the Enclave!"
################################################################################################################ 
enc_reformers.73.t: "The Forgotten Men and Women"
enc_reformers.73.d: "Although the NCR is a democracy, it's highly flawed.  Brahmin barons run the northern territories like feudal holdings, crushing small farmers and factory workers.  The caravans buy and sell senators for bottlecaps, and ethnic tensions simmer beneath the surface.  A leader who promised to restore Prewar America's ideals and rally the forgotten people of New California could be very successful.  With our aid."
enc_reformers.73.a: "We will remember those who have been forgotten."
################################################################################################################ 
enc_reformers.74.t: "The Failure at Shady Sands"
enc_reformers.74.d: "Mayor Hayes of Day Glow has called for a constitutional convention, with petitions from across the NCR. But the NCR's Congress has refused to hear it, claiming he's in league with the remnants of the Enclave.  At a protest in Boneyard, shots have been fired... and war was beginning."
enc_reformers.74.a: "The NCR is going HAYEwire!"
################################################################################################################ 
enc_reformers.75.t: "Operation Californian Freedom"
enc_reformers.75.d: "The Civil War in the NCR gives us the opportunity to support freedom and remove the NCR's taint from California.  And perhaps with a change of regime we'll have a pro-American voice in the Wastes..."
enc_reformers.75.a: "They will welcome us as liberators."
################################################################################################################ 
enc_reformers.76.t: "The State of California"
enc_reformers.76.d: "With the victory of the Old World Party and support for the Enclave at an all time high, it's time to restore California to the Union."
enc_reformers.76.a: "Out of Many, One."
################################################################################################################ 
enc_reformers.77.t: "Human Rights?"
enc_reformers.77.d: "Although the Reformers in the Enclave have recognized the average wastelander as an American citizen, a few fools even dare to call for equality for ghouls and mutants.  As absurd as it seems, some of the ghouls were actually citizens of prewar America..."
enc_reformers.77.a: "Mutants?  In my neighborhood?"
enc_reformers.77.b: "We fight not to enslave, but to set a country free."

enc_reformers.78.t: "The Return of Arcade Gannon"
enc_reformers.78.d: "Since the Enclave's reform and integration of American citizens, some of those who fled after the fall of Navarro have returned to us.  Most notable among those is the 'scientist' Arcade Gannon, who trained with the Followers of the Apocalypse. Inspired by our promises of a better life for the people of the Wastes and our technology, he's willing to work for us again. Although we don't like the courier he's dating."
enc_reformers.78.a: "I love a man in uniform."
enc_reformers.78.a.tt:  "Arcade Gannon is now available as a Theoretician."
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.79.t: "A Frumentarius Defects!"
enc_reformers.79.d: "As America wakes from its slumber and the Wasteland begins to rally to our cause, a former member of the Legion has appeared in New Reno, asking to join our army. He has taken the name Ulysses, after a great soldier who fought to unite America under one flag, and vows that when he sets his flag down, it'll be over his body or a nation he believes in."
enc_reformers.79.a: "Who are you, that you do not know your own history?"
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.80.t: "Horses!"
enc_reformers.80.d: "Although there were about 8 million horses in prewar America, they all died out due to the Great War, nuclear winter, and hungry survivors.  Now the EPA wants to use genetic engineering to revive horses and other large mammals rather than engineering Deathclaws with laser guns."
enc_reformers.80.a: "Great.  Now give them lasers."
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.81.t: "The New Economic Policy"
enc_reformers.81.d: "Now that we have reestablished the Federal Reserve, there's some debate as to just what our currency should be.  Some have proposed we tie the United States Dollar to the NCR Dollar, ensuring economic stability.  Others argue that we can force everyone to use the United States Dollar, driving the great New Californian Houses into bankruptcy and seizing their interests.  Doing so wiill upset the economy but increase our influence."
enc_reformers.81.a: "Make the NCRD worthless! Break the merchant houses."
enc_reformers.81.b: "An orderly integration into the American economy is best."
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.82.t: "The End of Bottlecaps"
enc_reformers.82.d: "Bottlecaps were an ingenious solution to the Wasteland's problems; how do you create a currency with no government?  The original bottlecaps were backed by potable water from the Hub, and because the bottlecaps could not be replicated in postwar conditions, they had a fixed store of value.  But as the Wasteland's economy grew, the limited supply of bottlecaps meant more goods were chasing less money, discouraging economic growth.  With the return of Old Glory to the Wastes, the Government can impose a rational currency worth whatever the government says it's worth."
enc_reformers.82.a: "Wait, isn't this why candy bars cost $1000 before the war?"
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.83.t: "The National Anthem"
enc_reformers.83.d: "The Reunited States must choose a national anthem.  Some say we should stick with the Star Spangled Banner, or perhaps the Battle Cry of Freedom.  But Secret Service spies in the Boneyard found a holodisc at a prewar bar called the Eagle by a singer named RuPaul.  Her song 'American' is a hit with the troops, for 'she's the stars and stripes flying high, red, white, and blue, she is me and you, she's American through and through.'"
enc_reformers.83.a: "The Star Spangled Banner Yet waves"
enc_reformers.83.b: "We rally once again, shouting the Battle Cry of Freedom"
enc_reformers.83.c: "The Enclave can learn from RuPaul."

enc_reformers.85.t: "The Chinese Menace!"
enc_reformers.85.d: "San Francisco was one of the greatest cities of Prewar America, a center of tech and a window to the world.  But now it's occupied by the Shi, a Chinese beachhead on American soil! Some say we must drive them into the ocean.  Others, mindful of Camp Turtledove and other prewar mistakes, suggest we give the city autonomy and welcome the Shi into the Reunited States."
enc_reformers.85.a: "A Chinatown on the west coast? I think not."
enc_reformers.85.b: "America was, and will be, home to many peoples."
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.86.t: "Bomb Bay"
enc_reformers.86.d: "San Francisco was one of the greatest cities of Prewar America, but it was also one of the weirdest, a center of free thinkers from all around the world.  That tradition has revived in the Free State, as eccentric scientists, dreamers, and doers move to the City.  The Shi form the nucleus of a new Bomb Bay, and cross-polination has led to new breakthroughs.  Shi science and Enclave engineering could bring us back to orbit within a decade, as Shi dust off plans for an old space plane..."
enc_reformers.86.a: "Groovy"

enc_reformers.87.t: "Baseball"
enc_reformers.87.d: "The president's decided to revive a prewar game to boost patriotism, and has gone on the radio with a new speech.  'We've been thinking quite a bit lately about something we can all relate to, something that is unquestionably, inescapably… American. I am referring, of course, to our great national pastime - baseball.  Now ask yourself this: What if Nevada's Gamblers could live again? What if they could compete with baseball teams from California, or Oregon? Put your faith in the Enclave, great America, and baseball will live again! Comfort, recreation, healthy competition - all will live again! This country WILL live again!'"
enc_reformers.87.a: "Play Ball!"
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.88.t: "The Ghosts of Our Fathers"
enc_reformers.88.d: "We rule much of northern Nevada, but some of our  citizens still fear the Enclave. They claim prewar America was a nightmare realm where the government seized people for sinister experiments, and that the Enclave sought to exterminate the Wasteland.  To reassure the populace, the President has decided to give a speech.  Will he focus on America's greatness, or our acknowledge our mistakes as we stumble towards a more perfect union?  As he stands before the microphone, the president begins, 'Hello, my beautiful America. This is the President, and it's time we had a talk...'"
enc_reformers.88.a: "Celebrate! Sing out! America is back! America IS beautiful!"
enc_reformers.88.b: "America is the worst form of government... except for all the others."

enc_reformers.89.t: "A Supreme Court Justice!"
enc_reformers.89.d: "Mr. President, astonishing news! A ghoul has appeared in New Reno who claims to be a surviving member of the Supreme Court! He says he was on a ski trip when the Great War break out, and spent the last two hundred years traveling the Wastes and administering justice.  We were skeptical, but the calendar checks out, and restoring him to the Supreme Court could be a big step towards reviving America's legal system."
enc_reformers.89.a: "I hope he hires good law clerks!"
enc_reformers.89.b: "I really doubt an octogenarian judge survived nuclear war."
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.90.t: "A Supreme Court Injustice!"
enc_reformers.90.d: "Mr. President, Archive historians have found records which prove conclusively that our Ghoul Supreme Court Justice was actually a traffic court judge! Some think we should get rid of him, but we have to admit brahmin convoys have never flowed so smoothly..."
enc_reformers.90.a: "I guess we shouldn't give a job to everyone who walks in the door"
enc_reformers.90.b: "Eh, he's still better than that guy from Vault City"

enc_reformers.91.t: "National Information Infrastructure"
enc_reformers.91.d: "PoisedoNet, EnclaveNet, the RobCo Mail... The hardened information networks that have survived the Great still operate in the Wastes, accessed by scavengers and fools.  One of our scientists has studied the network in Gecko and proposed a radical plan to link all of the computers together, creating a National Information Infrastructure.  And we could listen to all of it, with our enemies unaware."
enc_reformers.91.a: "Listening to your words to keep you safe!"
enc_reformers.91.b: "I guess it has scientific applications"
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.92.t: "Nuka Land!"
enc_reformers.92.d: "Before the Great War, New Reno was home to a park full of rides and games called 'Nuka Land.'  Although not as impressive as its east coast counterpart, we could revive it as a symbol of the promise of the better times to come.  And we can also test some experiments on the park goers..."
enc_reformers.92.a: "Unless this themepark trains deathclaws, pass."
enc_reformers.92.b: "Well, it's better than the plan to poison the world's water supply."
################################################################################################################
enc_reformers.93.t: "Nuka Land's Opening Day!"
enc_reformers.93.d: "After a year of construction, Nuka Land has opened to rave reviews and would be crushing competition if there was any other themepark in the Wastes.  Casualties from the deathclaw petting zoo are within acceptable parameters, the haunted house's feral ghouls provide excellent paramilitary training, and the rocket roller coaster is fun! For one brief day, America's citizens get a taste of what our nation will be like when we finish rebuilding.  Just obey park security."
enc_reformers.93.a: "Cutting in line has unpleasant consequences."

enc_reformers.99.d: "With Area 51 under our control, Enclave scientists are sifting through reams of prewar data.  It appears that the Prewar United States was monitored by vast intellicts cool and unsympathetic, and their technology was studied by the military.  We could pick this research up, but there may be consequences... "
